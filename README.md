# SDIS T2 G22

This project was developed for the Course Unit of Distributed Systems and this report has the main goal of describing and explaining, in detail, the implementation of the system and the reason behind most design choices.
The implemented system is able to execute 5 main protocols:
- Backup - Send a file to the system and store it with a specified replication degree
- Restore - Retrieve a file from the system
-  Reclaim - Set a Peerâ€™s max space to limit its maximum capacity (in bytes)
-  Delete - Delete all copies of a file from the system
-  State - Retrieve all relevant information about a Peer  

The architecture on which the system was built is a **Serverless Peer-to-Peer** architecture based on the **Chord** algorithm along with its fault-tolerant features. All Peers and Clients communicate through TCP sockets using **JSSE SSLSockets** to ensure security and reliability and make use of threads to ensure maximum scalability.  

### Compiling
Run the following bash script on the root directory:

```cmd
bash scripts/compile.sh
```


### Running

#### Peer

Run the following bash script on the root directory:  

```cmd
bash scripts/peer.sh <peer_port> [<known_peer_IP_address> <known_peer_port>]
```
**Note:** The first Peer will not have the \<known_peer_IP_address\> and \<known_peer_port\> arguments

#### Client
Run the following bash scripts also on the root directory, according to the desired operation:

**Backup**

```cmd
bash scripts/client.sh <known_peer_IP_address> <known_peer_port> BACKUP <file_path> <replication_degree>
```

**Restore**

```cmd
bash scripts/client.sh <known_peer_IP_address> <known_peer_port> RESTORE <file_path> 
```

**Delete**

```cmd
bash scripts/client.sh <known_peer_IP_address> <known_peer_port> DELETE <file_path> 
```

**Reclaim**

```cmd
bash scripts/client.sh <known_peer_IP_address> <known_peer_port> RECLAIM <max_disk_space>
```

**State**

```cmd
bash scripts/client.sh <known_peer_IP_address> <known_peer_port> STATE
```
**Note:** The capitalziation on the Operation name is not necessary

## Test Scripts
In order to test the program easier the following scripts are provided

**runMany.sh**

Runs 6 instances oh the peer.sh
```cmd
bash scripts/runMany.sh
```    

**shutdown.sh**

Graciously shuts down ALL the running peers and deletes their stored files 

**Warning:** this script deletes all the running Java processes in the machine
```cmd
bash scripts/runMany.sh
```
